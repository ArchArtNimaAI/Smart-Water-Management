# Smaer Water Management (SWM)

## Overview
During my internship at TESISQUARE, I worked on a project focused on leak detection within a Smart Water Management (SWM) system. The primary goal of this project was to detect water leaks in the distribution network by analyzing data from IoT-based smart meters and sensors. The detection of leaks is crucial for reducing water wastage, improving the efficiency of water distribution, and enhancing overall sustainability.

### Leak Detection Data Analysis:
In this project, I concentrated on analysing real-time data collected from the water distribution system. By monitoring parameters such as water flow rates, pressure levels, and consumption trends, I identified anomalies that could signify leaks. The analysis involved:
+ Data Preprocessing: 
Cleaning and organizing the raw sensor data, including handling missing values, time-series alignment, and noise reduction.
+ Anomaly Detection: 
By setting thresholds for normal water flow and pressure, deviations from typical patterns were detected. Unusual spikes or drops in these parameters were flagged as potential leaks.
Reporting and Visualization: The data analysis outputs were visualized using dashboards to display real-time leak detection. Alerts were set up to notify operators when potential leaks were detected, facilitating timely repairs.
