## Overview
During my internship at TESISQUARE, I worked on a project focused on leak detection within a Smart Water Management (SWM) system. The primary goal of this project was to detect water leaks in the distribution network by analyzing data from IoT-based smart meters and sensors. The detection of leaks is crucial for reducing water wastage, improving the efficiency of water distribution, and enhancing overall sustainability.

### 1- Leak Detection Data Analysis:
I concentrated on analysing real-time data collected from the water distribution system in this project. I identified anomalies that could signify leaks by monitoring parameters such as water flow rates, pressure levels, and consumption trends. The analysis involved:
+ Data Preprocessing: 
Cleaning and organizing the raw sensor data, including handling missing values, time-series alignment, and noise reduction.
+ Anomaly Detection: 
Setting thresholds for normal water flow and pressure detected deviations from typical patterns. Unusual spikes or drops in these parameters were flagged as potential leaks.
+ Reporting and Visualization:
The data analysis outputs were visualized using dashboards to display real-time leak detection. Alerts were set up to notify operators when potential leaks were detected, facilitating timely repairs.

### 2- Water Consumption Prediction and Efficiency Analysis:
In this project, I utilized supervised learning algorithms to predict water consumption patterns and assess inefficiencies in the system. Using techniques such as time-series analysis and neural networks, I evaluated various machine learning models to forecast water demand and identify areas of overconsumption or inefficiency.
+ Models Used: Neural Networks, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting were compared based on their prediction accuracy.
+ Evaluation Metrics: I used MAE and RMSE to assess the accuracy of these models and provided insights into reducing water consumption and optimizing resource allocation.
+ Outcome: Recommendations were made to enhance water usage efficiency, contributing to more sustainable water distribution.
